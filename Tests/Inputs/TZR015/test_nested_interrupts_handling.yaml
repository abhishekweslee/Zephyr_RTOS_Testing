  name: Nested Interrupts Handling
  id: TZR015
  description: |
    Test the handling of nested interrupts and priority-based preemption in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test triggers a chain of five interrupts with different priorities, ensuring that higher-priority
    interrupts preempt lower-priority ones as expected.
  type: functional
  category: Interrupt Handling
  prerequisites:
    - Hardware support for nested interrupts.
    - Proper IRQ line configuration on the target platform.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_TEST=y`
      - `CONFIG_IRQ_OFFLOAD=y`
      - `CONFIG_ASSERT=y`
    - Ensure IRQ lines 1 to 5 are valid and available.
  steps:
    - Configure and enable five interrupts (IRQ1 to IRQ5) with ascending priorities.
    - Trigger the lowest priority interrupt (IRQ1).
    - Each ISR triggers the next higher-priority IRQ in sequence.
    - Verify that higher-priority ISRs preempt lower-priority ones.
  expected_results:
    - "Zephyr Nested IRQ Test with 5 Levels" appears at startup.
    - Interrupts execute in ascending priority order, with IRQ5 executing last.
    - "Nested Interrupt Test Passed: Execution order verified." is logged.
    - No unexpected execution orders or missed interrupts occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Modify IRQ priorities to observe different nesting behaviors.
    - Test with varying delays to assess preemption timing.
    - Ensure proper stack handling to prevent overflow in nested ISRs.
