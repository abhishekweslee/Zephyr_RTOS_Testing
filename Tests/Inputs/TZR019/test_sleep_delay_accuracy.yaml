test:
  name: Sleep & Delay Accuracy
  id: TZR019
  description: |
    Verify the accuracy of `k_sleep()` and `k_busy_wait()` timing functions in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test measures the actual elapsed time during sleep and busy-wait operations and compares it to the expected durations.
  type: performance
  category: Timing and Delays
  prerequisites:
    - Serial and printing functionalities enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`
  steps:
    - Measure the accuracy of `k_sleep()` with a 1000 ms delay.
    - Measure the accuracy of `k_busy_wait()` with a 500000 µs delay.
    - Compare the actual elapsed times with the expected values.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Sleep & Delay Accuracy Test..." appears at startup.
    - Actual sleep duration is within acceptable deviation from 1000 ms.
    - Actual busy-wait duration closely matches the 500000 µs target.
    - No significant timing discrepancies are observed.
  additional_notes:
    - Test under different CPU loads to assess the impact on timing accuracy.
    - Adjust delay durations to explore timing behavior across various intervals.
    - Consider hardware timer calibration for improved precision.
