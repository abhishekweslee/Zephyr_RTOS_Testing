test:
  name: Task Starvation and Priority Inversion
  id: TZR005
  description: |
    Test task starvation and priority inversion scenarios in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test creates three tasks with varying priorities. The low-priority task holds a mutex,
    potentially blocking the high-priority task if priority inversion occurs without mitigation.
  type: functional
  category: Task Management
  prerequisites:
    - Mutex support enabled in Zephyr RTOS.
    - Logging and serial output configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_LOG=y`, `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`, and `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`.
    - Initialize mutexes before task execution.
  steps:
    - Start three tasks with HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priorities.
    - Low-priority task locks a mutex and simulates a long processing time.
    - High-priority task runs periodically, potentially getting blocked.
    - Medium-priority task interrupts execution, demonstrating potential starvation.
    - Observe whether priority inheritance prevents inversion.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Task Starvation & Priority Inversion Test" appears at startup.
    - Low-priority task logs successful mutex acquisition and release.
    - High-priority task runs without prolonged blocking due to priority inheritance.
    - Medium-priority task logs regular execution without causing starvation.
  additional_notes:
    - Test with and without priority inheritance enabled to observe differences.
    - Monitor timing between mutex acquisition and release to validate proper handling.
