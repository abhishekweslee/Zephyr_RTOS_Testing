test:
  name: Periodic Task Deadline Adherence
  id: TZR024
  description: |
    Verify the ability of a periodic task to meet its deadlines in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test measures the jitter between expected and actual task start times and detects any deadline misses.
  type: performance
  category: Task Scheduling and Timing
  prerequisites:
    - Timing functions and console logging enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_CONSOLE=y`
      - `CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
      - `CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_EXISTS=y`
      - `CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC=1000`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_MONITOR=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG_MODE_DEFERRED=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=3`
  steps:
    - Start a periodic task with a 1000 ms period.
    - Log the actual start time and calculate jitter from the expected wake-up time.
    - Simulate task execution workload (200 ms duration).
    - Sleep until the next period and check for deadline misses.
  expected_results:
    - Logs display jitter values close to 0 ms under normal conditions.
    - "Missed deadline" messages occur only under system stress or overload.
    - Execution time remains consistent across iterations.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust `PERIOD_MS` and workload duration to test system limits.
    - Introduce higher-priority tasks to analyze preemption effects.
    - Use external monitoring tools for precise timing validation.
