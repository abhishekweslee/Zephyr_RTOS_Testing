test:
  name: ISR Execution Time
  id: TZR014
  description: |
    Verify the execution time of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) in Zephyr RTOS.
    The test measures the time taken from triggering an interrupt to the ISR execution.
  type: performance
  category: Interrupt Handling
  prerequisites:
    - Valid IRQ line and hardware support for interrupts.
    - Logging and timing configurations enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`
      - `CONFIG_STDOUT_CONSOLE=y`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_GPIO=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMER=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG_MODE_IMMEDIATE=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=4`
    - Ensure `IRQ_LINE` corresponds to a valid interrupt on the target hardware.
  steps:
    - Connect and enable an IRQ handler.
    - Record the start time before triggering the interrupt.
    - Trigger the ISR and capture the end time upon execution.
    - Calculate and log the ISR execution time in nanoseconds.
  expected_results:
    - "Zephyr ISR Execution Time Test" log appears at startup.
    - ISR executes successfully with start and end times recorded.
    - ISR execution time is logged in nanoseconds.
    - No unexpected delays or failures occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Test on different IRQ lines to observe latency variations.
    - Repeat under varying CPU loads to assess consistency.
    - Ensure IRQ priorities are properly configured for accurate measurements.
