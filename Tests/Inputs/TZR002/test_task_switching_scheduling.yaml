  name: Task Switching and Scheduling Policies
  id: TZR002
  description: |
    Test task switching and scheduling policies in Zephyr RTOS, including Round-Robin and Priority-based scheduling.
    This test creates three tasks with HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priorities, demonstrating the system's scheduling behavior.
  type: functional
  category: Task Management
  prerequisites:
    - Multiple tasks configured with different priorities.
    - Timeslicing and multi-queue scheduling enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable printing and logging support.
    - Configure scheduler with timeslicing and priority settings.
  steps:
    - Observe log outputs to verify proper task switching.
    - Confirm high-priority tasks preempt lower-priority ones.
    - Validate Round-Robin behavior among same-priority tasks.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Task Scheduling Test..." message appears.
    - High priority task runs more frequently or preempts others.
    - Tasks with equal priority share CPU time in a round-robin fashion.
    - Logs consistently show task switching in line with scheduling policies.
  additional_notes:
    - Test edge-case priority values and varying timeslice sizes.
    - Verify no starvation occurs for lower-priority tasks.
