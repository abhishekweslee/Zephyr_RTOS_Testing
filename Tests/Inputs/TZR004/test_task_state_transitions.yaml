  name: Task State Transitions
  id: TZR004
  description: |
    Ensure correct task state transitions (READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, SUSPENDED) in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test creates three tasks with different priorities and demonstrates transitions using
    semaphores and thread suspension/resumption.
  type: functional
  category: Task Management
  prerequisites:
    - Multithreading and semaphore support enabled.
    - Logging and thread naming configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_MULTITHREADING=y`, `CONFIG_SEMAPHORE=y`, and `CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=y`.
    - Set logging level to default (`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL=3`).
  steps:
    - Observe initial task states (READY).
    - Verify transitions to RUNNING state upon execution.
    - Confirm medium priority task enters BLOCKED state while waiting on semaphore.
    - Suspend and resume medium priority task; validate corresponding state changes.
    - Release semaphore and ensure blocked task transitions to RUNNING.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Task State Transition Test..." log message appears.
    - Tasks display READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, and SUSPENDED states as expected.
    - Medium priority task unblocks after semaphore release.
    - Logs show correct suspend and resume actions.
  additional_notes:
    - Test edge cases by delaying semaphore release and observing blocked state duration.
    - Monitor logs to verify state consistency across multiple cycles.
