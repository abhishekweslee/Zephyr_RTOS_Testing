test:
  name: Context Switching Time
  id: TZR003
  description: |
    Validate the context switching time between tasks with different priorities in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test measures the time taken to switch context from one task to another and ensures it falls within acceptable thresholds.
  type: performance
  category: Task Management
  prerequisites:
    - Zephyr RTOS with multithreading enabled.
    - Logging and thread naming configured.
  setup:
    - Enable logging with appropriate log level.
    - Ensure `CONFIG_MULTITHREADING=y` and `CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=y` are set.
  steps:
    - Create three tasks with HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priorities.
    - Measure the cycle count before and after task execution to determine context switch time.
    - Log the measured context switch times.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Context Switching Test..." log message appears.
    - High, medium, and low priority tasks execute and log their activity.
    - Context switch times are consistently logged with measured cycle counts.
    - Measured times fall within acceptable performance thresholds.
  additional_notes:
    - Repeat the test under varying system loads to observe consistency.
    - Analyze outliers and ensure no significant deviations occur.
