  description: |
    Measure CPU load and task execution time in Zephyr RTOS. This test runs two load-generating tasks
    and a monitor task that periodically prints CPU usage based on runtime statistics.
  type: performance
  category: System Monitoring
  prerequisites:
    - Thread runtime statistics and timing functions enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS_USE_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
  steps:
    - Start two load tasks that generate CPU load via busy loops.
    - Launch a monitor task with higher priority to capture CPU usage.
    - Monitor prints execution cycles every 1000 ms.
  expected_results:
    - System boots and load tasks start consuming CPU resources.
    - Monitor task prints "CPU Usage: <cycles>" logs at regular intervals.
    - CPU usage increases under load and stabilizes over time.
    - No missed or delayed monitor logs occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust the number of load tasks to simulate different load conditions.
    - Change `MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS` for more frequent or less frequent monitoring.
    - Ensure sufficient stack sizes to prevent overflows.
