  name: Semaphore Operations
  id: TZR007
  description: |
    Verify semaphore acquisition and release in Zephyr RTOS. Three threads compete for a single semaphore,
    ensuring mutual exclusion and proper synchronization.
  type: functional
  category: Inter-task Communication
  prerequisites:
    - Semaphore support enabled.
    - Logging and serial output configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`, `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`, and `CONFIG_LOG=y`.
    - Define and initialize semaphore with one token.
  steps:
    - Create three threads at the same priority.
    - Each thread attempts to acquire the semaphore.
    - Threads hold the semaphore for a fixed duration before releasing it.
    - Verify that no two threads hold the semaphore simultaneously.
  expected_results:
    - "Semaphore Test: Started" message appears at the start.
    - Threads log attempts to acquire the semaphore.
    - Only one thread at a time logs successful acquisition.
    - All threads release the semaphore before others acquire it.
    - No deadlocks or starvation occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust hold and wait times to test responsiveness.
    - Increase the number of threads to observe contention effects.
