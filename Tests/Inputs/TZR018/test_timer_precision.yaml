  name: Timer Precision Validation
  id: TZR018
  description: |
    Verify the precision and accuracy of one-shot and periodic timers in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test measures the actual expiry times against expected durations to ensure timers trigger within acceptable tolerances.
  type: performance
  category: Timer Management
  prerequisites:
    - Timer functionality enabled in Zephyr configuration.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_LOG=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMER=y`
  steps:
    - Initialize and start a one-shot timer with a 1000 ms timeout.
    - Initialize and start a periodic timer with a 500 ms period.
    - Measure actual expiry times using `k_uptime_get` and log deviations.
    - Run the test for 3000 ms to observe multiple periodic expiries.
    - Stop the periodic timer after the test duration.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Timer Precision Test..." appears at startup.
    - One-shot timer expires approximately at 1000 ms with minimal deviation.
    - Periodic timer consistently expires every 500 ms within acceptable margins.
    - Logs show actual vs. expected timings for both timers.
    - Final log indicates the number of periodic triggers.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust timeouts to validate timer behavior under different intervals.
    - Test under system load to assess jitter and precision degradation.
    - Ensure hardware clock sources are stable for accurate timing.
