  name: Message Queue Handling
  id: TZR006
  description: |
    Verify the correct handling of message queues in Zephyr RTOS by sending and receiving messages
    with different task priorities. The test ensures that messages are sent and received in the correct order.
  type: functional
  category: Inter-task Communication
  prerequisites:
    - Message queue support enabled.
    - Logging and serial output configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`, `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`, and `CONFIG_LOG=y`.
    - Initialize message queues with appropriate sizes.
  steps:
    - Create three sender tasks with HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priorities.
    - Each sender sends multiple messages with a priority identifier.
    - Create a receiver task to read messages from the queue.
    - Verify that the receiver correctly logs message IDs and sender priorities.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Message Queue Priority Test" message appears at the start.
    - Sender tasks log messages indicating sent message IDs and priorities.
    - Receiver logs received messages in the correct order.
    - No message loss or unexpected ordering occurs.
  additional_notes:
    - Test full and empty queue scenarios to validate edge cases.
    - Increase MSGQ_SIZE to observe behavior with larger queues.
