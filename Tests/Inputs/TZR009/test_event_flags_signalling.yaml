test:
  name: Event Flags Signalling
  id: TZR009
  description: |
    Validate the correct usage of event flags in Zephyr RTOS for task synchronization.
    This test includes an event producer and consumer, demonstrating flag setting and waiting mechanisms.
  type: functional
  category: Inter-task Communication
  prerequisites:
    - Event support enabled.
    - Logging or printing configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_PRINTK=y` and `CONFIG_EVENTS=y`.
    - Initialize event structures before usage.
  steps:
    - Start producer and consumer threads.
    - Producer sets `EVENT_FLAG_1` and `EVENT_FLAG_2` with delays between them.
    - Consumer waits for each flag and logs reception.
  expected_results:
    - Consumer logs "Waiting for EVENT_FLAG_1..." and later "Received EVENT_FLAG_1" after the producer sets it.
    - Similar behavior observed for `EVENT_FLAG_2`.
    - Flags are received accurately with correct bit values.
  additional_notes:
    - Test with multiple consumers to verify flag broadcasting.
    - Modify delays to observe timing effects on synchronization.
