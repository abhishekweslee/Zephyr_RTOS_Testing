test:
  name: ISR Deadlock Detection
  id: TZR016
  description: |
    Verify that the system handles ISR execution without deadlocks in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test simulates an interrupt using `irq_offload` and ensures the ISR executes as expected.
  type: functional
  category: Interrupt Handling
  prerequisites:
    - Software interrupt offloading supported.
    - Timing and assertion features enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_TEST=y`
      - `CONFIG_ASSERT=y`
      - `CONFIG_IRQ_OFFLOAD=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMESLICING=y`
      - `CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC=1000`
      - `CONFIG_USERSPACE=n`
  steps:
    - Trigger a software interrupt using `irq_offload`.
    - Wait for ISR execution within the defined duration.
    - Verify that the ISR runs without causing a deadlock.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting ISR deadlock test..." and "Triggering software interrupt..." logs appear.
    - ISR executes and logs "ISR executed!".
    - Test passes if ISR executes within the test duration.
    - If the ISR does not execute, the test fails indicating potential deadlock.
  additional_notes:
    - Increase `TEST_DURATION` for edge-case timing validations.
    - Test under heavy CPU loads to assess ISR responsiveness.
    - Ensure that no resource locks are held indefinitely within the ISR.
