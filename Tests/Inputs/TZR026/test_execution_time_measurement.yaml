  name: Code Execution Time Measurement
  id: TZR026
  description: |
    Measure the execution time of a code block using CPU cycle counters in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test records start and end cycles around a simulated workload and converts the result to nanoseconds.
  type: performance
  category: Timing and Profiling
  prerequisites:
    - Timing functions and CPU cycle counters enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_MONITOR=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMESLICING=y`
      - `CONFIG_SCHED_THREAD_USAGE=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_ANALYZER=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
  steps:
    - Capture the cycle count before the code block using `k_cycle_get_32()`.
    - Execute the workload (a loop with 100000 iterations).
    - Capture the cycle count after execution.
    - Calculate and log the elapsed cycles and the converted time in nanoseconds.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting execution time measurement..." appears at startup.
    - Elapsed cycles and corresponding nanoseconds are logged.
    - Results show consistent timing across multiple runs under stable conditions.
  additional_notes:
    - Modify the loop iterations to test different workload durations.
    - Run under system load to assess timing variability.
    - Use higher-resolution counters if available for increased accuracy.
