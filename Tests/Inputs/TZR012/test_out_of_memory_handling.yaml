  name: Out-of-Memory Handling
  id: TZR012
  description: |
    Check the system's behavior when heap memory is exhausted in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test continuously allocates memory blocks until allocation fails, verifying proper error handling.
  type: functional
  category: Memory Management
  prerequisites:
    - Heap memory allocation enabled.
    - Standard C library support (Newlib) configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=4096`.
    - Enable `CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y`.
  steps:
    - Allocate 256-byte blocks in a loop.
    - Continue until `malloc` returns `NULL` (indicating no memory left).
    - Log the number of successful allocations and failure point.
  expected_results:
    - Allocations succeed until heap is exhausted.
    - "Out of memory!" message logs upon failure.
    - No crashes or undefined behavior occurs.
    - System remains responsive after failure.
  additional_notes:
    - Test with varying `BLOCK_SIZE` and heap sizes.
    - Use memory analyzers to confirm no leaks or corruption.
    - Verify system stability after hitting out-of-memory condition.
