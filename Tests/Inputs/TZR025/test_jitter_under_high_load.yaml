  name: Jitter Measurement Under High System Load
  id: TZR025
  description: |
    Measure task jitter in Zephyr RTOS under high system load conditions.
    This test runs a high-priority jitter measurement task and a low-priority CPU load task.
    It evaluates how system load impacts the scheduling precision of periodic tasks.
  type: performance
  category: Task Scheduling and Timing
  prerequisites:
    - Timeslicing and clock configurations enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=2048`
      - `CONFIG_TIMESLICING=y`
      - `CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC=1000`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
  steps:
    - Launch a jitter task with a 1000 ms period to record scheduled vs. actual start times.
    - Start a load task with frequent CPU usage to simulate high system load.
    - Log jitter measurements each cycle and monitor changes under load.
  expected_results:
    - Jitter remains minimal in low-load conditions.
    - High system load causes noticeable jitter but within acceptable ranges.
    - No missed periods or excessive delays occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust `LOAD_ITERATIONS` and `LOAD_TASK_PERIOD_MS` to vary system load.
    - Modify `JITTER_TASK_PRIORITY` to observe priority-based scheduling impacts.
    - Long-term testing helps identify cumulative jitter effects.
