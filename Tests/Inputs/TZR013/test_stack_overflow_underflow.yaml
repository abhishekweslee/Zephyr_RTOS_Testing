test:
  name: Stack Overflow and Underflow
  id: TZR013
  description: |
    Verify the system's ability to detect and handle stack overflow and underflow conditions in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test intentionally causes overflow by exceeding allocated stack size and underflow by manipulating the stack pointer.
  type: functional
  category: Memory Management
  prerequisites:
    - Stack protection and assertion features enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_TEST=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_MONITOR=y`
      - `CONFIG_ASSERT=y`
      - `CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION=y`
      - `CONFIG_STACK_CANARIES=y`
      - `CONFIG_STACK_SENTINEL=y`
      - `CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS=y`
  steps:
    - Start the stack overflow test by creating a thread with a small stack and exceeding its limit.
    - Start the stack underflow test by modifying the stack pointer to an invalid address.
    - Observe system response to both scenarios.
  expected_results:
    - System detects the stack overflow and prevents further execution.
    - Overflow attempt logs appropriate protection or fault messages.
    - Underflow triggers an assertion failure or fault detection mechanism.
    - "This should never print!" messages do not appear in logs.
  additional_notes:
    - Stack protection may reset or halt the system depending on hardware and configuration.
    - Test can be repeated with varying stack sizes for stress testing.
    - Ensure fault handlers are configured to capture exceptions for debugging.
