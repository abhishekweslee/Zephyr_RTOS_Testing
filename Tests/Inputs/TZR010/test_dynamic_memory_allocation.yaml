test:
  name: Dynamic Memory Allocation
  id: TZR010
  description: |
    Verify the functionality of dynamic memory allocation in Zephyr RTOS using `k_malloc` and `k_free`.
    This test allocates memory, writes and verifies data, and ensures proper deallocation.
  type: functional
  category: Memory Management
  prerequisites:
    - Heap memory pool configured.
    - Malloc and free support enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=1024`.
    - Enable standard library memory functions (`CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y`).
    - Set aligned heap size (`CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_ALIGNED_HEAP_SIZE=1024`).
  steps:
    - Allocate 64 bytes of memory using `k_malloc`.
    - Write incremental data to the allocated block.
    - Read back and verify data integrity.
    - Free the allocated memory with `k_free`.
  expected_results:
    - "Testing dynamic memory allocation..." log appears.
    - Memory allocation succeeds with valid address logging.
    - Data verification passes with no corruption detected.
    - Memory is freed successfully without leaks.
  additional_notes:
    - Test varying allocation sizes to observe heap usage.
    - Check behavior when allocation exceeds available heap.
    - Use memory analysis tools to detect leaks or corruption.
