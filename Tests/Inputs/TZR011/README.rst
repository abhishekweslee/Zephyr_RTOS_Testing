Memory Fragmentation Behavior
=============================

**Test Case ID:** TZR011  
**Category:** Memory Management  

Overview
--------
This test validates how Zephyr RTOS handles memory fragmentation. 
It simulates fragmentation by allocating and freeing memory blocks in a pattern, then attempts a larger allocation to assess impact.

Key aspects tested:
- Fragmentation impact on subsequent allocations
- Systemâ€™s ability to handle non-contiguous free memory
- Memory cleanup and prevention of leaks

Prerequisites
-------------
- Heap memory pool enabled (`CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=4096`)
- Newlib C library enabled (`CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y`, `CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC=n`)
- Standard output enabled (`CONFIG_PRINTK=y`, `CONFIG_STDOUT_CONSOLE=y`)

Expected Output
---------------
- Initial 256-byte blocks are allocated successfully.
- Every other block is freed to simulate fragmentation.
- Large 512-byte block allocation success or failure is logged.
- Remaining blocks are freed, ensuring no leaks.

Sample Log
----------

Additional Notes
----------------
- Change `NUM_BLOCKS` or `ALLOC_SIZE` to explore fragmentation thresholds.
- Use external tools to monitor real-time heap usage.
- Test under long-term allocation/free cycles to assess fragmentation buildup.
