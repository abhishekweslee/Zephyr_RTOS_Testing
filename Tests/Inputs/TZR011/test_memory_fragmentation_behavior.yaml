test:
  name: Memory Fragmentation Behavior
  id: TZR011
  description: |
    Validate memory fragmentation behavior in Zephyr RTOS. This test performs multiple allocations
    and deallocations to simulate fragmentation and assesses the system’s ability to handle larger
    memory requests under fragmented conditions.
  type: performance
  category: Memory Management
  prerequisites:
    - Heap memory allocation enabled.
    - Standard C library support (Newlib) configured.
  setup:
    - Enable `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=4096`.
    - Enable `CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y` and disable `CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC`.
    - Enable standard output (`CONFIG_PRINTK=y`, `CONFIG_STDOUT_CONSOLE=y`).
  steps:
    - Allocate 10 blocks of 256 bytes each.
    - Free every other block to simulate fragmentation.
    - Attempt to allocate a larger 512-byte block.
    - Log success or failure of large block allocation.
    - Free remaining allocated blocks.
  expected_results:
    - All initial allocations succeed with valid addresses logged.
    - Freed blocks are logged correctly.
    - Large block allocation succeeds if fragmentation is minimal.
    - Allocation failure indicates potential fragmentation issues.
    - Test completes without memory leaks or corruption.
  additional_notes:
    - Vary allocation sizes and patterns to stress different fragmentation scenarios.
    - Monitor heap usage with Zephyr’s memory analysis tools.
    - Repeat allocations to evaluate long-term fragmentation effects.
