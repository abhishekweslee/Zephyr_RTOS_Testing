  name: Task Execution Time Profiling Under Varying Conditions
  id: TZR023
  description: |
    Measure and profile the execution times of tasks with varying loads and priorities in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test launches multiple tasks with different workload intensities and logs their execution cycles.
  type: performance
  category: Task Scheduling and Profiling
  prerequisites:
    - Thread runtime statistics and timing functions enabled.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS_USE_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=y`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
  steps:
    - Create three load tasks with low, medium, and high loads.
    - Each task executes a busy loop simulating work of varying intensities.
    - A monitor task prints system status at regular intervals.
    - Tasks log their execution time in cycles after each workload iteration.
  expected_results:
    - System boots with clear indication of profiling start.
    - Low, medium, and high load tasks log their execution cycles consistently.
    - Higher load tasks show significantly longer execution times.
    - Monitor task prints system status every 2 seconds without disruption.
  additional_notes:
    - Adjust `LOAD_ITERATIONS` to vary workload intensities.
    - Modify task priorities to observe preemption effects.
    - Test under additional system load to assess scheduler behavior.
