test:
  name: Task Creation, Deletion, and Priority Assignment
  id: TZR001
  description: |
    Verify that tasks can be created, deleted, and assigned different priorities in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test creates three threads with varying priorities, ensures they run as expected, and 
    then deletes them. Logs confirm successful creation, execution, and termination of threads.
  type: functional
  category: Task Management
  prerequisites:
    - Zephyr RTOS running on the target board
  setup:
    - Ensure logging is enabled (CONFIG_LOG=y).
    - Enable thread monitoring and name support.
  steps:
    - Build and flash the firmware.
    - Observe the logs for thread creation messages with assigned priorities.
    - Verify that threads run for the specified duration and exit.
    - Check that threads are properly deleted.
  expected_results:
    - "Task Management Test Started" log appears.
    - Threads 1, 2, and 3 start with HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priorities respectively.
    - Each thread runs, logs execution, and exits after the defined delay.
    - Logs indicate successful deletion of each thread.
    - "Task Management Test Completed" log appears.
  additional_notes:
    - Validate behavior with different priority values and task delays.
    - Ensure no resource leaks occur after thread deletion.
