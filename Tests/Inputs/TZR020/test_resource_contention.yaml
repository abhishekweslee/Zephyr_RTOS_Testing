  name: Resource Contention Simulation
  id: TZR020
  description: |
    Verify proper synchronization and mutual exclusion when multiple threads access a shared resource.
    This test simulates contention between two threads trying to access a resource protected by a mutex.
  type: functional
  category: Synchronization
  prerequisites:
    - Threading and mutex support enabled in Zephyr.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_THREAD_MONITOR=y`
  steps:
    - Create two threads with equal priority.
    - Both threads repeatedly attempt to acquire the same mutex.
    - Each thread holds the resource for 1000 ms upon acquisition.
    - Threads log access attempts, acquisitions, and releases.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Resource Contention Simulation..." appears at startup.
    - Only one thread accesses the resource at a time.
    - Logs show orderly acquisition and release without overlap.
    - No deadlocks or race conditions occur.
  additional_notes:
    - Modify sleep durations to test different contention scenarios.
    - Increase the number of threads to evaluate system scalability.
    - Enable priority inheritance if priority inversion is observed.
