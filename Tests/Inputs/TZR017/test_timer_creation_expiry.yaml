test:
  name: Timer Creation, Deletion & Expiry
  id: TZR017
  description: |
    Verify the correct creation, expiration, and deletion of timers in Zephyr RTOS.
    This test initializes a timer, starts it in one-shot mode with periodic intervals,
    validates the expiry callback execution, and ensures proper timer stopping.
  type: functional
  category: Timer Management
  prerequisites:
    - Timer support enabled in Zephyr configuration.
  setup:
    - Enable the following configurations:
      - `CONFIG_SERIAL=y`
      - `CONFIG_PRINTK=y`
      - `CONFIG_TIMER=y`
  steps:
    - Initialize the timer with expiry and stop callbacks.
    - Start the timer with a 1000 ms timeout and 500 ms periodic interval.
    - Wait for the timer to expire and verify callback execution.
    - Stop and delete the timer.
  expected_results:
    - "Starting Timer Creation, Deletion & Expiry Test..." appears at startup.
    - Timer initializes and starts successfully with correct timeout and period logs.
    - "Timer expired! Callback executed." appears after the set duration.
    - "Test Passed: Timer expired as expected." confirms successful expiry.
    - Timer stops without issues and logs appropriate messages.
  additional_notes:
    - Test with different timeouts and periods to validate versatility.
    - Use high-resolution timing for precise expiry validation.
    - Monitor system behavior for timer-related resource leaks.
